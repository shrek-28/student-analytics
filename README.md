# Dataset Details 
- The Dataset has 1000 rows, and eight columns: race, gender/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score and writing score.
- Various factors, and their cumulative and individual effects on average student and individual student scores.

# Creating the table and Loading the Dataset
Command used for creating the table:
````sql
CREATE TABLE "Student Analytics"(
gender varchar(100),
race varchar(100),
parental_level_of_education varchar(100),
	lunch varchar(100),
	test_preparation_course varchar(100),
	"math score" int, 
	"reading score" int,
	"writing score" int
);

````
The dataset was loaded into the table by usage of the PGAdmin Import tool.  

An overview of the dataset was loaded using the following command:
````sql
SELECT * FROM student_analytics LIMIT 5;
````
result:
